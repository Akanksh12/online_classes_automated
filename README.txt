this project was done so us students going through this pandemic can go hands-free!

how to operate:

1) select which day is it today?(Monday, Tuesday...)
2)You can change the link and code as per your wish to adapt to your schedule(the one there is mine)

For downloading either click on show code or click on go to file to download file (you may have to disable windows defender till you run the program safely then toggle it back on)
or else just click on the code dropdown and download zip then extract the files

Note: the program may not repond but minimize when you get the option and it will run as usual.
